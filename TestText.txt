Ah Tony, it's been a long time! I've been missing you, even though we haven't contacted and seen each other for a long time. Whenever I think of you, I always feel that that time is not enough, I want to show you how I look now and other changes, so much to have you by my side. You know, Tony, I always cherish our friendship and hope we can get together soon.
